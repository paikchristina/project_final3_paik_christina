### Resources:

*[fullcalendar.js]()
Full Calendar is a jQuery plugin that was utilized to create a calendar with events for the "Events" page.

*[Owl Carousel]()
Owl Carousel is a jQuery plugin that enables slideshows. This was utilized on the index.html page for the rotating slideshow of the "Product of the Month" as well as the "BOGO Promotion."

*[moment.min.js]()
Moment.min.js is a necessary jQuery library for fullcalendar.js.

*[.fadeIn()](https://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/)
.fadeIn() is a jQuery effect that allows for the selected element to fade to opaque. This was utilized on the "Products" page for the banner.

### Deductions:

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

###  Comments:

The custom jQuery code can be seen on the "Products" page. When the main banner is clicked, the image slowly fades away.

The custom JavaScript can be seen on the "Events" page. The introductory paragraph was created using pure JavaScript.
